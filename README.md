# Interactive Front-End Project | Movie Night


## Project Summary

In this day and age we as consumers have access to millions of movies through the vast amounts of streaming services available to the public. As such, we often find ourselves overwhelmed by these many options. We find that there is a need for an application that allows us to search for any movie, and be able to view its ratings, as well as bookmark those that stand out to us. 

We propose the development of an application that uses web APIâ€™s, such as that of IMBD and others, to host a catalog of movies that when selected would instantly tell the user simple information such as ratings, synopsis, and provide a movie posters. Additionally, in future developmet we aim for features that allow users to easily discover which platforms each movie could be streamed.

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## Stretch Goals
- In the future we plan to include access to an API that allows for a user to easily find out where a movie can be streamed. 
- We plan to have access to other sources of movie ratings, such as Rotten Tomatoes and possibly a crowd-sourced rating system. 
- We plan to include more information such as the run time of the film. S
