## Project Proposal 

In this day in age we as consumers have access to millions of movies through the vast amounts of streaming services available to the public. As such, we often find ourselves overwhelmed by these many options. For example, many of us have found ourselves desperately wanting to watch a certain movie or show, only to discover that it is not available on our favored streaming service. Instead of forcing the average consumer to desperately search the catalogs of several different websites, it is our goal to help streamline the movie watching process. 

We propose the development of an application that uses web APIâ€™s, such as that of IMBD and others, to host a catalog of movies that when selected would instantly tell the user simple information such as where this movie is available to stream, as well as potentially content such as ratings or synopses.
